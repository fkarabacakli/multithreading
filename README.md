# Multithreading Integration in My Project

This project demonstrates how multithreading was integrated into one of my earlier projects to enhance performance and efficiency. Previously, tasks were handled sequentially, but with multithreading, tasks now run concurrently, improving execution speed and resource utilization.

## Benefits of Multithreading

- **Improved Speed:** Tasks such as data processing and file generation are now distributed across multiple threads, significantly reducing execution time.
- **Better Resource Utilization:** Multithreading utilizes system resources more efficiently, particularly for I/O or computationally intensive tasks.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** The project can now handle larger datasets and more complex tasks with ease.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added a multithreading module to manage concurrent tasks.
- Ensured thread-safe operations using locks to prevent race conditions.
- Each thread handles a specific task, like data processing or I/O operations, independently but efficiently.

## Example Use Case
In the **getBilanco** project:
- **Before Multithreading:** Financial reports were fetched and processed one at a time, leading to longer execution times.
- **After Multithreading:** Reports are now fetched and processed in parallel, drastically reducing the overall processing time and enabling faster analysis.
